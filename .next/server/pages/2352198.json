Infusing Digital Metal’s solution into The Digital Forge platform allows us to address new applications in the medical, automotive, luxury goods and other industries,&#8221; said Shai Terem, president and CEO of Markforged. &#8220;The Digital Metal team has created a robust and scalable solution that complements our existing technologies. I look forward to welcoming their talented people to Markforged.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Digital Metal was originally founded in 2003, and the company has built a name for itself for metal parts that are used in consumer products, automotive use and for experimental and prototyping use.

The companies expect to close the merger by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>The industrial 3D printing space has seen a number of interesting evolutions recently, as companies are starting a consolidation phase.

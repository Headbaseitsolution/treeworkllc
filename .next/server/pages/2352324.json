It&#8217;s also betting on ridable robot unicorns for kids.</p>\n<p>Xpeng Robotics, a bionic robot maker affiliated with Xpeng, just raised an impressive $100 million in a Series A round led by IDG Capital, at a time when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-30/china-is-leading-the-global-contraction-in-venture-capital-deals?sref=gni836kR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">venture investments are slowing in China</a>.</p>\n<p>Other investors include Xpeng itself and some undisclosed backers. It&#8217;s unclear how much control Xpeng has over Xpeng Robotics following the latest round. But given their shared brand association, it won&#8217;t be surprising the two firms are closely tied up &#8212; at least on the development front. Technologies like autonomous driving that Xpeng has been working on are easily applicable to the robot business.</p>\n<p>Indeed, as Xpeng&#8217;s chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said in a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220712005559/en/XPENG-Robotics-Completes-US100-Million-Series-A-Fund-Raising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also believe that in the future, manufacturers of smart cars will also be manufacturers of smart robots&#8230; As part of our mission as a technology innovator and explorer, we will continue to provide support to Xpeng Robotics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Xpeng Robotics calls itself an &#8220;ecosystem company&#8221; of Xpeng.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2016, Xpeng Robotics&#8217;s first product is a quadruped robot that can navigate autonomously and interact with humans. In a 3D <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&amp;tpcc=TCtransportationnewsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teaser</a> revealed last September, the pony-like robot is seen nodding and blinking to a kid &#8212; and riding him around. In another <a href=\"https://weibo.com/7625513125/KEcoY2iTk?layerid=4695807960549278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> shot in real life, the pony is transporting snacks around an office in response to voice commands and trailing behind a human.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen a variety of companion robots, like Shenzhen-based <a href=\"https://www.elephantrobotics.com/en/mars-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elephant Robotics&#8217; cutesy bionic cat</a>, but few are of the size of Xpeng Robotics&#8217;s pony, which is as tall as a kid. One can imagine the R&amp;D costs poured into finding a product-market fit for the quadruped robot and actually making it work.</p>\n<p>Six years into operation, Xpeng Robotics still has not set a delivery date for its robots, though it said in its <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220712005559/en/XPENG-Robotics-Completes-US100-Million-Series-A-Fund-Raising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a> that it expects &#8220;intelligent robots to enter households in the next two years.&#8221; The project is clearly not something that can be undertaken by a scruffy startup without the backing from a deep-pocketed patron.</p>\n<p>The funding will allow Xpeng Robotics to deepen its R&amp;D investment in robotic hardware and software, hire &#8220;top-tier talent,&#8221; and accelerate product development and iteration.</p>\n<p>The startup is headquartered in the global hardware hub Shenzhen with R&amp;D centers in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Silicon Valley. It has over 300 employees to date, 80% of whom work in R&amp;D.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YfwtrPg0fP\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/ev-upstart-xpeng-is-expanding-beyond-china/\">EV upstart Xpeng is expanding beyond China</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;EV upstart Xpeng is expanding beyond China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/ev-upstart-xpeng-is-expanding-beyond-china/embed/#?secret=JI86lrtbgB#?secret=YfwtrPg0fP\" data-secret=\"YfwtrPg0fP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>China&#8217;s Tesla challenger Xpeng isn&#8217;t content with just making electric vehicles.

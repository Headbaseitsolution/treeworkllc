The existence of exoplanets raises a fundamental question: Are we alone in the universe? Indeed, the explicit goal of NASA’s Exoplanet Program is to find signs of life in the universe; now, thanks to JWST, scientists can capture more information about these planetary bodies, and hopefully learn more about whether life exists on these planets and, if so, under what conditions it can thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings us to WASP-96 b, an exoplanet that’s located around 1,150 light-years away. It’s a large gas giant that\u0026#8217;s more than twice as small in mass as Jupiter, but is 1.2 times larger in diameter. In other words, it’s “puffy,” as NASA put it. It also has a short orbital period around its star and is relatively uncontaminated by light emitted from nearby objects, making it a prime target for JWST’s optical power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"piano-inline-promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this isn\u0026#8217;t an image of an exoplanet\u0026#8217;s atmosphere. It\u0026#8217;s an image of a the exoplanet\u0026#8217;s transmission spectrum, which might be less than exciting at first glimpse. However, this spectrum, captured with the telescope’s near-infrared imager and slitless spectrograph (NIRISS), showed unambiguous signs of water and even evidence of clouds. Clouds! It\u0026#8217;s an \u0026#8220;indirect method\u0026#8221; to study exoplanets, James Webb deputy project scientist Knicole Colón explained in a media briefing, but the telescope will also use direct observation methods over the next year as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNIRISS can also capture evidence of other molecules, like methane and carbon dioxide.

Google confirmed to us his comments were based on internal research that involved a survey of U.S. users, ages 18 to 24. The data has not yet been made public, we\u0026#8217;re told, but may later be added to \u003ca href=\"https://blog.google/competition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eGoogle\u0026#8217;s competition site\u003c/a\u003e, alongside other stats \u0026#8212; like how 55% of product searches now begin on Amazon, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"piano-inline-promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile older internet users may not be able to wrap their minds around turning to a social video app to find a restaurant, this trend could cut into Google\u0026#8217;s core business of search and discovery over time \u0026#8212; not to mention the ads sold against those sorts of queries. While younger users may eventually launch some sort of maps app for navigation purposes, this data indicates they don\u0026#8217;t necessarily start their journey on Google anymore. That means all the work Google did over the years to organize, curate and recommend various businesses \u0026#8212; \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/02/google-maps-adds-curated-restaurant-recommendations-in-nyc-san-francisco-and-london/\"\u003esuch as local restaurants\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212;  or its creation of \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/the-new-google-maps-with-personalized-recommendations-is-now-live/\"\u003ediscovery tools inside Google Maps\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; could be lost on these younger internet users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaghavan also explained how younger people were generally interested in more \u0026#8220;visually rich forms\u0026#8221; of search and discovery, and that wasn\u0026#8217;t just limited to where to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed out that the young people coming online today had never seen a paper map \u003cem\u003e(oof, way to make us feel old!)\u003c/em\u003e, but maps products have been designed to look like a paper map that\u0026#8217;s been \u0026#8220;stuck on the phone.\u0026#8221; This doesn\u0026#8217;t meet younger users\u0026#8217; expectations and is the wrong experience to offer them, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We have to conjure up completely new expectations and that takes altogether new … technology underpinnings,\u0026#8221; Raghavan noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, Google Maps is \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-maps-gets-improved-live-view-ar-directions/\"\u003enow incorporating augmented reality\u003c/a\u003e to help users position themselves in their environment, instead of forcing users to figure out which way to go based on a blue dot flashing on the screen.

He believed this is part of Search\u0026#8217;s ongoing evaluation, however. Previously, he explained, web users would type in a couple of basic keywords into a search engine to get a list of blue links in return. Later, search engines became capable of understanding natural language and then added capabilities for handling voice queries. In some countries, voice now drives 30% of all queries, the exec noted, as new internet users didn\u0026#8217;t even bother with typing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Google is looking toward combining images and text as it imagines a future where users could hold up their phone \u0026#8212; \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/\"\u003eor perhaps wear AR glasses\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; to start a search based on what they see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OITOnWt5RJ\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/\"\u003eGoogle\u0026#8217;s new \u0026#8216;multisearch\u0026#8217; features hint toward an AR glasses future\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u0026#8220;Google\u0026#8217;s new \u0026#8216;multisearch\u0026#8217; features hint toward an AR glasses future\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/embed/#?secret=mlLSOYeLmj#?secret=OITOnWt5RJ\" data-secret=\"OITOnWt5RJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, however, Google has to contend with no longer being some users\u0026#8217; first stop when they\u0026#8217;re looking to discover new places or information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis trend, in fact, was becoming so pronounced that the tech giant confirmed last fall it was working on deals that would allow it \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-seeks-search-deals-for-tiktok-and-instagram-videos?rc=48qqgg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eto index Instagram and TikTok videos in Search\u003c/a\u003e.

The cart already had the ability to weigh produce directly in the basket to eliminate further steps of the checkout process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Dash Cart will have extended battery life, and it is also weather-resistant, so shoppers can charge their carts less and take it all the way to their cars regardless of the weather conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"piano-inline-promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the company\u0026#8217;s software will be more precise about the location of the cart to better notify shoppers about deals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaunched in \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/\"\u003e2020\u003c/a\u003e, the smart shopping cart eliminates the need to stand in checkout lines as users can sign into the Amazon or Whole Foods Market app and then use the AI-powered cameras near the handlebar of the Dash Cart to scan their items. Once the shopper is finished grabbing items, all they have to do is exit through the Amazon Dash Cart lane, and the credit card associated with their Amazon account gets charged for the groceries. The Dash Cart’s screen shows a real-time receipt of the items in the cart, and it gets emailed to them after they leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oAbthx1C45\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/\"\u003eAmazon to test Dash Cart, a smart grocery shopping cart that sees what you buy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u0026#8220;Amazon to test Dash Cart, a smart grocery shopping cart that sees what you buy\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/embed/#?secret=vB4yRNvzpA#?secret=oAbthx1C45\" data-secret=\"oAbthx1C45\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eWhile Prime Day deals flood our notifications, the retail team at Amazon announced a revamped Dash Cart with new conveniences and technology upgrades for shoppers to further enjoy the excitement that is purchasing groceries.

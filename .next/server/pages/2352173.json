Elon brings us a meme-driven lawsuit for the books"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When Elon Musk announced his intention to terminate his $44 billion bid for Twitter, the social media company didn&#8217;t give up easily. Today, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/twitter-sues-elon-musk/\">Twitter sued</a> the SpaceX and Tesla CEO for refusing to uphold his contractual obligation to buy the platform. The company&#8217;s lawyers claim that Musk&#8217;s concerns about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/20/a-twitter-bot-wrote-this-for-elon-musk/\">Twitter&#8217;s bot numbers</a> are illegitimate.</p>\n<p>When you agree to buy a slow-growing social media platform for more than it&#8217;s worth, there&#8217;s no take-backsies, unless the company seriously misrepresented itself. Even though Twitter handed over its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/twitter-hand-over-data-musk-bot-spam-accounts/\">&#8220;firehose&#8221; of internal data</a>, Musk claimed the trove of information wasn&#8217;t sufficient. So he extended his ongoing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/elon-musk-twitter-spam/\">public tantrum</a> over Twitter bots, which culminated in his declaration that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/08/elon-musk-not-buying-twitter-sec/\">the deal was off</a>.</p>\n<p>As Twitter wrote in its lawsuit against the erratic billionaire, &#8220;Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.&#8221; In response to the lawsuit, Musk tweeted, &#8220;Oh the irony lol.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh the irony lol</p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1546980241494745100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>Anyone with a Twitter account (even the bots!) has seen that Musk has been <em>tweeting through it</em>. Based on the memes he&#8217;s posted, it wasn&#8217;t shocking at all that he was getting cold feet about his $44 billion impulse buy &#8212; especially in light of the stock market downturn.</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawyers agreed: &#8220;In his press release announcing the deal on April 25, 2022, Musk raised a clarion call to &#8216;defeat the spam bots.&#8217; But when the market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding &#8216;verification&#8217; that spam was not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need to conduct &#8216;diligence&#8217; he had expressly forsworn.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>How do you prove that an extremely online, mega-wealthy troll is trying to dupe you? You show the receipts. And the receipts in this case happen to be memes.</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawsuit against Musk has more pictures than your standard legal filing. Throughout the sixty-two page document, the plaintiff shares several images of Musk&#8217;s tweets (mostly memes about the acquisition) to prove that he has acted in bad faith. Of course, they included the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526246899606601730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526246899606601730%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2022%2F05%2F16%2Felon-musk-posts-poop-emoji-after-twitter-ceo-touts-handling-of-bots%2F\">poop emoji</a> that Musk tweeted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal when he attempted to answer the mogul&#8217;s spam inquiries.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2352266\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2352266\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2352266\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Elon Musk responds to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal with a poop emoji on Twitter\" width=\"680\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png 1264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=150,148 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=300,296 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=768,757 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=680,670 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=96,96 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2352266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elon Musk responds to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal with a poop emoji on Twitter</p></div></p>\n<p>As part of the agreement between Musk and Twitter, Musk is in violation if he disparages the platform. According to Twitter, that poop emoji does, indeed, count as disparagement, but the platform&#8217;s lawyers pulled several more tweets to make their case. In two other instances, Musk tags the SEC&#8217;s Twitter account and calls upon them to investigate Twitter&#8217;s financial disclosures, which have claim that more than 95% of monetizable daily active users are humans. As the lawsuit reads, &#8220;Musk’s conduct simply confirms that he wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed, and to damage Twitter in the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2352290\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2352290\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2352290\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"An image from Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk showing that he is trying to escape the contract\" width=\"680\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png 1040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=768,580 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=680,514 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2352290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2352288 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"An image from Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk showing that he is trying to escape the contract\" width=\"680\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png 1508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawyers also included a meme that Musk posted just yesterday, which shows the billionaire laughing alongside text making fun of the platform: &#8220;They said I couldn&#8217;t buy Twitter.

Elon brings us a meme-driven lawsuit for the books"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When Elon Musk announced his intention to terminate his $44 billion bid for Twitter, the social media company didn&#8217;t give up easily. Today, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/twitter-sues-elon-musk/\">Twitter sued</a> the SpaceX and Tesla CEO for refusing to uphold his contractual obligation to buy the platform. The company&#8217;s lawyers claim that Musk&#8217;s concerns about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/20/a-twitter-bot-wrote-this-for-elon-musk/\">Twitter&#8217;s bot numbers</a> are illegitimate.</p>\n<p>When you agree to buy a slow-growing social media platform for more than it&#8217;s worth, there&#8217;s no take-backsies, unless the company seriously misrepresented itself. Even though Twitter handed over its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/twitter-hand-over-data-musk-bot-spam-accounts/\">&#8220;firehose&#8221; of internal data</a>, Musk claimed the trove of information wasn&#8217;t sufficient. So he extended his ongoing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/elon-musk-twitter-spam/\">public tantrum</a> over Twitter bots, which culminated in his declaration that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/08/elon-musk-not-buying-twitter-sec/\">the deal was off</a>.</p>\n<p>As Twitter wrote in its lawsuit against the erratic billionaire, &#8220;Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.&#8221; In response to the lawsuit, Musk tweeted, &#8220;Oh the irony lol.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh the irony lol</p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1546980241494745100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>Anyone with a Twitter account (even the bots!) has seen that Musk has been <em>tweeting through it</em>. Based on the memes he&#8217;s posted, it wasn&#8217;t shocking at all that he was getting cold feet about his $44 billion impulse buy &#8212; especially in light of the stock market downturn.</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawyers agreed: &#8220;In his press release announcing the deal on April 25, 2022, Musk raised a clarion call to &#8216;defeat the spam bots.&#8217; But when the market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding &#8216;verification&#8217; that spam was not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need to conduct &#8216;diligence&#8217; he had expressly forsworn.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>How do you prove that an extremely online, mega-wealthy troll is trying to dupe you? You show the receipts. And the receipts in this case happen to be memes.</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawsuit against Musk has more pictures than your standard legal filing. Throughout the sixty-two page document, the plaintiff shares several images of Musk&#8217;s tweets (mostly memes about the acquisition) to prove that he has acted in bad faith. Of course, they included the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526246899606601730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526246899606601730%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2022%2F05%2F16%2Felon-musk-posts-poop-emoji-after-twitter-ceo-touts-handling-of-bots%2F\">poop emoji</a> that Musk tweeted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal when he attempted to answer the mogul&#8217;s spam inquiries.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2352266\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2352266\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2352266\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Elon Musk responds to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal with a poop emoji on Twitter\" width=\"680\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png 1264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=150,148 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=300,296 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=768,757 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=680,670 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-6.43.41-PM.png?resize=96,96 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2352266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elon Musk responds to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal with a poop emoji on Twitter</p></div></p>\n<p>As part of the agreement between Musk and Twitter, Musk is in violation if he disparages the platform. According to Twitter, that poop emoji does, indeed, count as disparagement, but the platform&#8217;s lawyers pulled several more tweets to make their case. In two other instances, Musk tags the SEC&#8217;s Twitter account and calls upon them to investigate Twitter&#8217;s financial disclosures, which have claim that more than 95% of monetizable daily active users are humans. As the lawsuit reads, &#8220;Musk’s conduct simply confirms that he wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed, and to damage Twitter in the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2352290\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2352290\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2352290\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"An image from Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk showing that he is trying to escape the contract\" width=\"680\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png 1040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=768,580 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=680,514 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.24.33-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2352290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2352288 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"An image from Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk showing that he is trying to escape the contract\" width=\"680\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png 1508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-7.21.11-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawyers also included a meme that Musk posted just yesterday, which shows the billionaire laughing alongside text making fun of the platform: &#8220;They said I couldn&#8217;t buy Twitter.

The existence of exoplanets raises a fundamental question: Are we alone in the universe? Indeed, the explicit goal of NASA’s Exoplanet Program is to find signs of life in the universe; now, thanks to JWST, scientists can capture more information about these planetary bodies, and hopefully learn more about whether life exists on these planets and, if so, under what conditions it can thrive.</p>\n<p>That brings us to WASP-96 b, an exoplanet that’s located around 1,150 light-years away. It’s a large gas giant that&#8217;s more than twice as small in mass as Jupiter, but is 1.2 times larger in diameter. In other words, it’s “puffy,” as NASA put it. It also has a short orbital period around its star and is relatively uncontaminated by light emitted from nearby objects, making it a prime target for JWST’s optical power.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t an image of an exoplanet&#8217;s atmosphere. It&#8217;s an image of a the exoplanet&#8217;s transmission spectrum, which might be less than exciting at first glimpse. However, this spectrum, captured with the telescope’s near-infrared imager and slitless spectrograph (NIRISS), showed unambiguous signs of water and even evidence of clouds. Clouds! It&#8217;s an &#8220;indirect method&#8221; to study exoplanets, James Webb deputy project scientist Knicole Colón explained in a media briefing, but the telescope will also use direct observation methods over the next year as well.</p>\n<p>NIRISS can also capture evidence of other molecules, like methane and carbon dioxide.

The company was previously owned by Swedish metal powder manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.hoganas.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Höganäs AB</a>.</p>\n<p>The acquisition highlights Markforged&#8217;s push into additive manufacturing for industrial customers, and with Digital Metal&#8217;s powder-binding jetting machine lineup, the company unlocks large-scale, high-volume metal part production capabilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the Digital Metal acquisition, Markforged is advancing our vision for distributed manufacturing by enabling the reliable, high-volume production of precise metal parts at the point of need. Infusing Digital Metal’s solution into The Digital Forge platform allows us to address new applications in the medical, automotive, luxury goods and other industries,&#8221; said Shai Terem, president and CEO of Markforged. &#8220;The Digital Metal team has created a robust and scalable solution that complements our existing technologies. I look forward to welcoming their talented people to Markforged.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Digital Metal was originally founded in 2003, and the company has built a name for itself for metal parts that are used in consumer products, automotive use and for experimental and prototyping use. The company shares that its printers have been used to produce hundreds of thousands of parts</p>\n<p>&#8220;Markforged’s easy-to-use platform, best-in-class software capabilities and material expertise felt like a natural fit for the future of our technology,” said Christian Lönne, CEO of Digital Metal. &#8220;With Markforged’s experience and go-to-market scale, we are confident that we will be able to grow our technology together and help more manufacturers produce the high-volume metal parts they need to drive highly productive and cost-efficient operations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of the transaction, Markforged will pay Höganäs around $32 million in cash, plus around 4.1 million shares of Markforged common stock. With today&#8217;s Markforged share price of around $1.9, the total deal works out to be in the neighborhood of $40 million in total. The companies expect to close the merger by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>The industrial 3D printing space has seen a number of interesting evolutions recently, as companies are starting a consolidation phase.

exec suggests Instagram and TikTok are eating into Google&#8217;s core products, Search and Maps"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The TikTok threat to Google&#8217;s business isn&#8217;t just limited to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/15/youtube-shorts-tops-1-5b-logged-in-users-monthly-users-touted-as-feeder-to-long-form-content/\">YouTube</a>, as it turns out. Core Google services, including Search and Maps, are also being impacted by a growing preference for social media and videos as the first stop on younger users&#8217; path to discovery, a Google exec acknowledged today, speaking at an industry event.</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President Prabhakar Raghavan, who runs Google&#8217;s Knowledge &amp; Information organization, referenced the popular social apps in a broader conversation at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/conferences/fortune-brainstorm-tech-2022/agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune&#8217;s Brainstorm Tech</a> conference about the future of Google&#8217;s products and its use of AI.</p>\n<p>In a discussion about the evolution of search, he somewhat offhandedly noted that younger users were now often turning to apps like Instagram and TikTok instead of Google Search or Maps for discovery purposes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We keep learning, over and over again, that new internet users don&#8217;t have the expectations and the mindset that we have become accustomed to.&#8221; Raghavan said, adding, &#8220;the queries they ask are completely different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These users don&#8217;t tend to type in keywords but rather look to discover content in new, more immersive ways, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they&#8217;re looking for a place for lunch, they don&#8217;t go to Google Maps or Search,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They go to TikTok or Instagram.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The figure sounds a bit shocking, we have to admit. Google confirmed to us his comments were based on internal research that involved a survey of U.S. users, ages 18 to 24. The data has not yet been made public, we&#8217;re told, but may later be added to <a href=\"https://blog.google/competition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s competition site</a>, alongside other stats &#8212; like how 55% of product searches now begin on Amazon, for example.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>While older internet users may not be able to wrap their minds around turning to a social video app to find a restaurant, this trend could cut into Google&#8217;s core business of search and discovery over time &#8212; not to mention the ads sold against those sorts of queries. While younger users may eventually launch some sort of maps app for navigation purposes, this data indicates they don&#8217;t necessarily start their journey on Google anymore. That means all the work Google did over the years to organize, curate and recommend various businesses &#8212; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/02/google-maps-adds-curated-restaurant-recommendations-in-nyc-san-francisco-and-london/\">such as local restaurants</a> &#8212;  or its creation of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/the-new-google-maps-with-personalized-recommendations-is-now-live/\">discovery tools inside Google Maps</a> &#8212; could be lost on these younger internet users.</p>\n<p>Raghavan also explained how younger people were generally interested in more &#8220;visually rich forms&#8221; of search and discovery, and that wasn&#8217;t just limited to where to eat.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that the young people coming online today had never seen a paper map <em>(oof, way to make us feel old!)</em>, but maps products have been designed to look like a paper map that&#8217;s been &#8220;stuck on the phone.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t meet younger users&#8217; expectations and is the wrong experience to offer them, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to conjure up completely new expectations and that takes altogether new … technology underpinnings,&#8221; Raghavan noted.</p>\n<p>For instance, Google Maps is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-maps-gets-improved-live-view-ar-directions/\">now incorporating augmented reality</a> to help users position themselves in their environment, instead of forcing users to figure out which way to go based on a blue dot flashing on the screen. The company also recently announced other improvements to Google Maps at its developer conference Google I/O, where it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/google-maps-challenges-apples-3d-mode-with-a-new-immersive-view-for-cities/\">showed off new 3D modes and immersive views</a>, among other things, that also make Maps less like a digital form of a paper map.</p>\n<p>Raghavan also suggested younger people&#8217;s demand for visual content will change Google Search. He believed this is part of Search&#8217;s ongoing evaluation, however. Previously, he explained, web users would type in a couple of basic keywords into a search engine to get a list of blue links in return. Later, search engines became capable of understanding natural language and then added capabilities for handling voice queries. In some countries, voice now drives 30% of all queries, the exec noted, as new internet users didn&#8217;t even bother with typing.</p>\n<p>Today, Google is looking toward combining images and text as it imagines a future where users could hold up their phone &#8212; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/\">or perhaps wear AR glasses</a> &#8212; to start a search based on what they see.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OITOnWt5RJ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/\">Google&#8217;s new &#8216;multisearch&#8217; features hint toward an AR glasses future</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google&#8217;s new &#8216;multisearch&#8217; features hint toward an AR glasses future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/googles-new-multisearch-features-hint-towards-an-ar-glasses-future/embed/#?secret=mlLSOYeLmj#?secret=OITOnWt5RJ\" data-secret=\"OITOnWt5RJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In the meantime, however, Google has to contend with no longer being some users&#8217; first stop when they&#8217;re looking to discover new places or information.</p>\n<p>This trend, in fact, was becoming so pronounced that the tech giant confirmed last fall it was working on deals that would allow it <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-seeks-search-deals-for-tiktok-and-instagram-videos?rc=48qqgg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to index Instagram and TikTok videos in Search</a>. You can see some of this progress already &#8212; search for a keyword followed by the word &#8220;TikTok&#8221; and Google will return rows of results of TikTok videos before you&#8217;ll see any standard webpages.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-2352200 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-4.30.30-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>But Google has also begun to leverage AI to analyze videos on the web and direct users to richer search results, Raghavan said.</p>\n<p>For example, if you search how to change a tire on Google, it will now show you video results. And now, Google is able to use AI to analyze the parts of the video, so users can jump to the location where it explains how to loosen the lug nuts or raise the jack. The company is working to make its analysis and understanding of video to be on par with documents, Raghavan said.</p>\n<p>But, he added, &#8220;getting that level of deeper understanding is a journey we&#8217;re still on.&#8221;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The TikTok threat to Google&#8217;s business isn&#8217;t just limited to YouTube, as it turns out.

gives Dash Cart a makeover and brings the shopping tech to Whole Foods"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">While Prime Day deals flood our notifications, the retail team at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-dash-cart-new-features-whole-foods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> a revamped Dash Cart with new conveniences and technology upgrades for shoppers to further enjoy the <em>excitement</em> that is purchasing groceries. The cart will also now be featured in select Whole Foods Market stores.</p>\n<p>The most notable updates include the ability to carry more groceries, changes to the software on the touchscreen and that shoppers can now wheel the cart to their cars.</p>\n<p>Customers at the Whole Foods Market store in Westford, Massachusetts, will be the first to test the new version. The Dash Carts were previously only available at the company’s Amazon Fresh grocery stores, which are currently only available in <a href=\"https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/amazon-fresh-grows-concept-competitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">six states</a>.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, the new carts will expand to additional Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon Fresh stores across the U.S., giving more customers an opportunity to use the convenient shopping technology.</p>\n<p>Not only did the Amazon team design a lighter cart, but it also has a larger capacity to carry four grocery bags instead of two. There is also a separate shelf for delicate items such as eggs and a lower shelf for oversized items like a 40-count pack of water bottles. So shoppers can use the Dash Cart regardless of if they want only a small number of items or if they&#8217;re planning for a barbecue with friends.</p>\n<p>Amazon altered the software on the touchscreen in order to display images of nearby fresh fruit and produce. So instead of typing in a four-digit Price Look Up code located on the produce stickers, the shopper can simply type which item they want. The cart already had the ability to weigh produce directly in the basket to eliminate further steps of the checkout process.</p>\n<p>The new Dash Cart will have extended battery life, and it is also weather-resistant, so shoppers can charge their carts less and take it all the way to their cars regardless of the weather conditions.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Also, the company&#8217;s software will be more precise about the location of the cart to better notify shoppers about deals.</p>\n<p>Launched in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/\">2020</a>, the smart shopping cart eliminates the need to stand in checkout lines as users can sign into the Amazon or Whole Foods Market app and then use the AI-powered cameras near the handlebar of the Dash Cart to scan their items. Once the shopper is finished grabbing items, all they have to do is exit through the Amazon Dash Cart lane, and the credit card associated with their Amazon account gets charged for the groceries. The Dash Cart’s screen shows a real-time receipt of the items in the cart, and it gets emailed to them after they leave.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oAbthx1C45\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/\">Amazon to test Dash Cart, a smart grocery shopping cart that sees what you buy</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon to test Dash Cart, a smart grocery shopping cart that sees what you buy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/embed/#?secret=vB4yRNvzpA#?secret=oAbthx1C45\" data-secret=\"oAbthx1C45\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While Prime Day deals flood our notifications, the retail team at Amazon announced a revamped Dash Cart with new conveniences and technology upgrades for shoppers to further enjoy the excitement that is purchasing groceries.
